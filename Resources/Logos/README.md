*What would traditionally be seen as a four pillared structure representing government is an image with four people instead of pillars, symbolizing the government exists because of the people, and without the support of the people, the government collapses. The individuals are also standing on top of the stairs, representing the hard work it will take in order for us to have a system that can work for everyone within it.*
